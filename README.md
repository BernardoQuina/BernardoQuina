## Hi there 👋 I'm Bernardo

Full-stack developer crafting type-safe experiences from frontend to cloud. I build scalable systems where strong typing meets infrastructure as code.

### What I'm about

- 🛠️ Building with **TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **AWS** (and **Python** when I really have to)
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code enthusiast (CloudFormation is my second language)
- 💪 Strong advocate for type safety across the entire stack
- 🌲 Nature explorer when away from the keyboard
